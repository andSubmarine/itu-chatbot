A little helper for all students and employees at the [IT-University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk).
In the current version, the chatbot is able to answer room related questions like:

`Is room 3A52 available?`

`Can I use room 5A12 tomoorow at noon?`

## Usage
You can always contact the chatbot at [https://m.me/itu-chatbot](https://m.me/itu-chatbot)

## Worth knowing
This projected is sponsored by [Hostly](https://hostly.dk), who is hosting the chatbot!

The chatbot uses Wit.ai to parse and extract meaning of messages. You can see and fork the chatbot parsing functionalities [overthere](https://wit.ai/NiclasHedam/itu-chatbot).

## Contributing
