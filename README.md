A little helper for all students and employees at the [IT-University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk).
In the current version, the chatbot is able to answer room related questions like:

`Is room 3A52 available?`
`Can I use room 5A12 tomoorow at noon?`

## Worth knowing
This projected is sponsored by [Hostly](https://hostly.dk), which is hosting the chatbot and it's source code!
The chatbot uses Wit.ai to parse and extract meaning of messages. You can see and fork the chatbot parsing functionalities [overthere](https://wit.ai/NiclasHedam/itu-chatbot).

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

I'll obviously help with integrating the changes to the wit.ai chatbot and deploy it to Hostly.
